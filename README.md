## Description
This website was built as my answer to the Semester Project task. We were tasked with creating a website for a local community science museum for children and their families. I chose to use a dark layout with a white header and the home page uses anchor tags to allow the user to jump to the next section of content. I used a shade of purple as a central part of the design.
